## Security Best Practices for Users

To protect your deployment:

- Only include **trusted CA certificates** in `ca-bundle.pem`
- Protect `web.config` and the `bin/` folder with **NTFS ACLs**
- Set strict file permissions on `403c.html` and error content
- Disable directory browsing on `/error` folder
- Enable logging for `302` redirects and failed requests
- Periodically **rotate and re-sign** internal CA certificates
- Verify that the `clientcertnegotiation=enable` setting is enforced in IIS
- Use TLS 1.2 or higher only

## Known Limitations

- The module uses .NET Framework `X509Chain` which may not support all custom PKI environments.
- Revocation checks rely on CRL distribution points being reachable from the server.
