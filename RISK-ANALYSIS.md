## üß© Introduction

The module protects backend systems by enforcing strict client authentication using mutual TLS (mTLS). It performs certificate validation against trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs), checks certificate validity periods and trust chains, and blocks unauthorized users before they reach application logic.

| R7      | Accidental issuer acceptance via CN match  | CN collision may cause false acceptance  | Low        | Medium     | Strict X500 matching minimizes this                      |
| R8      | Human error in web.config                  | Critical values missing or empty         | Medium     | Medium     | Fallback exists, but some values are essential           |
